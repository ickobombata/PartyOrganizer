# Project Title

Project for organizing parties in some time and arbitrary place.

The main goal of this organizer is for a group of people to be on time in some arbitrary place(meet up point).
* The group of people can create Tasks needed to be done before the meet up point and also the tasks can be assigned/in progress/done.
* The group of people can create Things taken. Like Marto is taking his Hamack. -> We have 1 Hamack.
* Chat for the group.
* Pictures space. which can be shared with other social networks
* GPS tracking system, which will show at each time where is everyone and how long will they take to get to the meet up point. This way the group of the people will know when is the best time to start running to the meet up point.
